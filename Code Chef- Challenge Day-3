2
2 students won't be able to get tickets.

Test case

04)Audible Range:
Chef's dog binary hears frequencies starting from 
67
67 Hertz to 
45000
45000 Hertz (both inclusive).

If Chef's commands have a frequency of 
𝑋
X Hertz, find whether binary can hear them or not.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer 
𝑋
X - the frequency of Chef's commands in Hertz.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line YES, if binary can hear Chef's commands. Otherwise, print NO.

The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.
